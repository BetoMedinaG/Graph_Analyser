# Proyecto_Integrador
Computational system that generates a graph from the analysis of an image, that produces a vertex for each circle that is in the image and connects with others generating adjacencies (edges) as long as a straight line can be drawn from a vertex (origin) to another (destination). Any figure in the image can obstruct the connection from one vertex to another, even the same vertices.
